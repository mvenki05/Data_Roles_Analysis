# Data Science Salary Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to Data Science salaries. The goal of the analysis is to understand salary trends, identify factors that influence compensation, and uncover patterns in the data using various data visualization techniques. Leveraging Python and libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, the analysis delves into key variables such as job title, location, experience, and company size.

### Key objectives include:

- Analyzing salary distribution across different job titles and levels of experience.
- Identifying geographical trends in salary data.
- Exploring correlations between salary and various factors like company size, job sector, and location.
- Visualizing trends and patterns to provide actionable insights for career and hiring decisions.

This project demonstrates my expertise in performing comprehensive data analysis and visualizing trends to support data-driven decision-making in the context of the Data Science industry.
